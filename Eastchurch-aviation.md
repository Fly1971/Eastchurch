The Isle of Sheppey off the north Kent coast, best known for its dockyard, three prisons and various holiday sites, holds a distinguished place in history for a very different reason.   On this small island in the early 20th century, aviation in Britain was born.

After the Wright Brother’s first powered flight in a heavier-than-air machine on 17th December 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, USA, Wilber and Orville Wright continued refining their design working towards achieving controlled, manoeuvrable aircraft capable of sustained flight.  Despite achieving something that would forever alter the course of humanity, at the time the brothers struggled to get commercial interest with both British and American governments failing to see the potential in fixed wing flying.  But a group of fellow pioneers in Britain watched closely as they understood the significance of this breakthrough.

Charles Rolls (of Rolls Royce fame and fortune) together with Vera & Frank Hedges Butler and others were a group of balloon enthusiasts (ballon picture) passionate about aviation, and in 1901 founded the Aero Club of Great Britain (becoming the Royal Aero Club in 1910) to nurture the sport of ballooning and advance interest and the development of aviation.   Charles Rolls met the Wright brothers whilst selling cars in America and stayed in touch.  With Europe achieving their first flight in a heavier-than-air machine in 1906, Charles and friends were frustrated at Britain’s attitude to fixed-wing flying and set about trying to change things.  They spoke with the Aero Club’s aeronautical engineers, Eustace and Oswald Short.  The third brother and fellow engineer Horace Short was unimpressed with ballooning had found work elsewhere, but when the Short brothers were approached about the idea of working with the Wright brothers, he joined them and became a key player in what happened next.

In 1908, Horace Short and members from the Aero Club including Charles Rolls, Griffith Brewer, Frank Hedges Butler and Major Baden Powell went to France to see a demonstration of the Wright Flyer and were each given flights by Wilder.  Horace rejoiced ‘This is the end of ballooning!’ and negotiations began for the production of the Wright Flyer in the UK resulting in a contract being agreed for the Short Brothers to build the first six Flyers.  Now, they needed a site.

The Short Brother’s balloon manufacturing business was based in Battersea, London, but for the production of aircraft they needed a flat open space free from obstacles, enabling miles of safe flying around the airfield.  Griffith Brewer was tasked with finding a suitable site and he suggested Shellness, Leysdown on the Isle of Sheppey.  Most ballon ascents were made from London so the members of the Aero Club were familiar with the Thames Estuary region and Sheppey offered everything they needed.  A 400 acre golf course was purchased with the accompanying Muswell Manor house, which would become home to the Aero Club.  Member and aviation enthusiast Frank McClean paid for the work to alter the land to accommodate powered flight, creating the first airfield in Britain and the aviation legacy of the Isle of Sheppey began in earnest.  The year was 1909 . 

In February of that year, Horace Short met with the Wright Brothers in Pau, France.  He made quick pencil sketches of the aircraft as there were no blueprints, but it was all the genius engineer needed to take the designs back to the UK and with his brothers Eustace and Oswald, establish the first aircraft factory in Britain (possibly the first in the world) at Sheerness, Leysdown, Isle of Sheppey, Kent, producing Wright Flyers under license from the Wright Brothers in America.  Production was underway by the end of April 1909 and  with the Aero Club based here too, Sheppey began its exciting journey into the unknown.

In April 1909, Aero Club member and aviation enthusiast J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon made history on the Isle of Sheppey by becoming the first Briton to officially pilot a powered aircraft in the UK, and went on to be awarded the Aero Club’s Pilot’s certificate No. 1. in 1910.  His flight, which took place on Shellbeach, another aviation first for the island, demonstrated the potential of powered flight in Britain, and inspired a new generation of early aviation pioneers to push boundaries through experimentation and engineering innovation, setting records and making history.

Days after Brabazon’s record-setting flight, the Wright Brothers visited the site to approve the production of their aircraft.  Charles Rolls chauffeured the Wright’s around the site in his Rolls Royce and they complimented the airfield, factory, and workmanship. Wilber Wright said ‘This is the best flying ground I have ever seen.  It is much superior in every way to those we have used elsewhere.’ The brothers joined members of the Aero Club for a luncheon in Muswell Manor and afterwards posed for a photograph outside the front  of the building.   It features, Mr T D F Andrews (owner of the manor), Oswald, Horace and Eustace Short, Frank McClean, Griffith Brewer, Frank Hedges Butler, Dr WJS Lockyer, Warwick Wright, JTC Moore-Brabazon, Wilber and Orville Wright and the Hon CS Rolls.  This photograph is known as ‘The Founding Fathers’, and is regarded by many as the most famous aviation picture ever taken capturing a moment in history during the birth of aviation as we know it.

With a production team of 80 and Horace’s brilliant engineering mind, the Shorts soon developed their own design and on 30th October JTC Moore-Brabazon achieved another first by becoming the first person in Britain to fly a circular mile in a British-built machine. Moore-Brabazon went on to famously fly carrying a small piglet in a wicker basket, a publicity stunt to jokingly prove that pigs could fly; an act that would probably be disapproved of today but in 1909 it captured the public imagination and highlighted the pioneering spirit of the time.

The Wright Brothers visited Shellness again in August and October 1909, by which point the limitations of the site were becoming apparent and an alternative site had been acquired by Frank McClean at Stonepits Farm, Eastchurch, where CS Rolls had already been teaching himself to fly.  The Wright Brothers were taken to see the new more substantial aerodrome and in 1910, all production and flying relocated to Eastchurch, catapulting the site into a hub for pioneers, exploration and innovation, and becoming the centre of British civil and military aviation.
